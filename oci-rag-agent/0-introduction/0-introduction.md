# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This lab demonstrates how to integrate Generative AI Agents with Oracle APEX by leveraging OCI Object Storage and Generative AI Agents. Learn how to combine the power of large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with the simplicity of Oracle's low-code platform. In this lab, you'll upload documents to OCI Object Storage, use Generative AI Agents to process and extract insights from enterprise data, and surface intelligent, context-aware responses directly within your APEX applicationsâ€”enhancing automation, user engagement, and business productivity in a secure, scalable environment.

Estimated Time: 90 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:

- Creating an Agent in OCI Generative AI Agents.

- Add API Keys in the OCI Console.

- Create Web Credentials in Oracle APEX.

- Create Session and Ingestion Job using OCI Ingestion Job REST APIs.

- Set up an automation to monitor the status of incomplete Ingestion Jobs.

- Create and invoke a REST Data Source in your APEX app using the OCI Generative AI Agents' Create Sessions REST API.

- Design and customize a Classic Report for the chat widget.

- Interact with OCI Generative AI Agents through the Chat REST API.

>*Note: This workshop assumes you are using Oracle APEX 24.2.*

## Prerequisites

- A paid Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) account or a FREE Oracle Cloud account with $300 credits for 30 days to use on other services. Read more about it at: [oracle.com/cloud/free/](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/).

- An OCI compartment. An Oracle Cloud account comes with two pre-configured compartments - The tenancy (root compartment) and ManagedCompartmentForPaaS (created by Oracle for Oracle Platform services).

- The logged-in user should have the necessary privileges to create and manage Autonomous Database instances in this compartment. You can configure these privileges via an OCI IAM Policy. If you are using a Free Tier account, it is likely that you already have all the necessary privileges.
